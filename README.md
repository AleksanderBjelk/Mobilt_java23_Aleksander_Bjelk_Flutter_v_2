This is the final assignment for the course "Mobilutveckling med Java".
```
School: Gritacademy 
Class: Java 23
Teacher: Alrik He
```


## Description
In this assigment I have created an app where you can press a button to switch page using routes. The app is functional in web and Android. While in the second page you can "press" a picture (an image button) to choose two different outcomes based on the [Matrix movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/). Choosing the red pill takes you to the movie IMDB page, choosing blue takes you to a different website while using web. If you are using Android, choosing the blue pill kills the app.<br>
<br>
